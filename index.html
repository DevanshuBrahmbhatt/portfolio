                        <h2>Hello There!</h2>
                        <p> As a highly motivated and solution-oriented software engineer, I am pursuing
                            Master of Science in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Arlington. I am also a
                            research assistant at the Wireless and Sensor Systems Lab (WSSL).
                        </p>
                        <p> I completed my IT Engineering degree at Dharmsinh Desai University in 2021, with a focus on
                            learning and knowledge acquisition. My passion for entrepreneurship and technology has led
                            me to excel in challenging environments, where I am driven by determination, passion and
                            creativity.</p>
                        <p>With 1.5+ years of experience as a software engineer at Rakuten, a Japanese MNC, I am
                            well-versed in the software development life-cycle and have experience managing end-to-end
                            projects from concept to delivery. I am experienced in creating innovative software
                            solutions that enhance business productivity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to my technical skills, I am an effective communicator and enjoy public speaking
                            and discussing ideas with entrepreneurs. I have experience working on startups and have even
                            started my own. My goal is to achieve excellence in computer science by solving real-world
                            problems and coding challenges, and my mantra is <b>"If you decide you can."</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Furthermore, I am excited to announce my new position as a Research Intern at 
                            LBL National Lab for this summer, focusing on Quantum Computing. This opportunity 
                            will further expand my expertise and contribute to research in the field. <br>

                                            1. As an Associate Software Engineer 1 at Rakuten, I design and develop a highly scalable Content Management System
                                            (CMS) microservice using Spring Boot for the Rakuten App Store team.<br><br>
                                            2. I contributed to the team by promoting Test-Driven Development by writing
                                            unit tests using PHPUnit, which helped to improve the overall quality of the
                                            codebase.<br><br>
                                            3. I was able to effectively maintain, debug, and work on legacy code to
                                            match new requirements, and was promoted to Software Engineer 1 within 7

                                            and implemented complex concepts such as threading to complete the project
                                            and demoed it to stakeholders within 3 months.<br><br>

                                            3. I worked on PHP and Google Analytics to improve the performance of the
                                            website and to learn more about website analytics, which helped me to
                                            understand how to measure website performance and identify areas for
                                            improvement. <br><br>
